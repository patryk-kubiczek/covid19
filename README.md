## COVID-19 cases in Germany

The repository contains scripts to download actual and historic data on COVID-19 cases in Germany from Robert Koch Institute (https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html) and to do some basic analysis. The scripts can be run from `covid19-germany.ipynb`. Or you can just download the scraped [dataset](covid19-germany-lands.csv).
